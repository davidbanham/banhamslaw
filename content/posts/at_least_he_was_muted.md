> In a rush between meetings and not enough time to make a coffee, I filled up the pour over kettle and prepped everything and brought it to my desk. Excused myself for having to put myself on mute while a make a coffee in front of everyone, please continue, I'm listening... begin pouring, and 30secs later my lap is very hot. Had forgotten to put the v60 on the jug and I'm just brewing directly onto my desk 🤦‍♂️
